# Facture

(Yeah it needs a better name.)
I made this app to manage who owes money to who in the appartment. Ex: I pay for the Internet, but another roommate pays the rent, sometimes we share food, etc. Basically, you add bills, say who paid for it, say who should pay a part of it. With that information, it tells who should send money to who.

You can mark payments as "paid" once to keep track of payments you did to other people.
